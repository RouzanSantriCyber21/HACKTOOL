# Underxploit Shell
File Manager &amp; Hacking Tools

I made this shell with a responsive design and easy to access through any device, not only that this script design optimizes for acceleration when loading. 

Version 0.1.3 prioritizes file manager features such as copy, move, zip compress, extract zip, edit, upload, etc.

For the hacking feature I made it in version 0.1.4 and only features that often exist in other shells such as jumping and symlinks. 

You can add hacking features by adding the source to the shell, especially when the open source script is not encrypted and is clean of logs.
